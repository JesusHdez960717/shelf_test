## Winter Framework

This project aims to be a lightweight web server to create BASICS services and APIs
This is an EXPERIMENTAL project, and it's by no means a ready for production framework, use it at your own discretion

**This project is:**

- An **experimental** framework
- A lightweight library for create rest APIs
- A *hobby* project in which we work when we have some spare time

**This project is NOT:**

- A ready for production framework
- A fullstack framework to create all kind of webs (just simple rest apis, for the moment at least)
- A complete project (most of the features are extremely basics)

Now that we have made all this clear, **let's start**

### How to start the server:

```dart

```
